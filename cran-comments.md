Submission (March 17, 2023)

Thank you for taking the time to review the CRE 0.2.1 package. In this update we:

- We replaced BATE with ATE in CATE Linear Decomposition.
- We updated `plot()` function (remove ATE, old BATE, and explicit AATEs).
- We added code of conduct to the package.
- We fixed a bug with rank-deficient rule matrix issue (redundant rules).
- We fixed a bug with intervention variables filtering (ordered filtering).

All tests and checks were successful. We also checked the package on rhub.
