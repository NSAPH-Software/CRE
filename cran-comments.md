Submission (December 5, 2023):

We appreciate your efforts in reviewing the CRE 0.2.5 package. In this upgrade, we:

- Fixed a note raised in some of CRAN checks. 
- Refactored some of internal functions. 
- Added (vanilla) Stability Selection (without Error Control).
- Added `max_rules` hyper parameters for max rules filtering.
- Added Uncertainty Quantification in estimation by bootstrapping.
- Added predict() function for ITE estimation via CRE.

All tests and checks have passed successfully.
