Thank you for taking the time to review the CRE 0.1.0 package.

- We removed the example from an internal function.  
- We made sure that we were not using more than two cores in the examples. 
- We addressed the options issue in the code.

Thank you so much for your invaluable feedback.

* This is a new release.

Thank you for taking the time to review the CRE 0.1.0 package. 
The CRE package provides an interpretable identification of subgroups with heterogeneous causal effects. The heterogeneous subgroups are discovered through ensemble learning of causal rules. Causal rules are highly interpretable if-then statements that recursively partition the feature space into heterogeneous subgroups. A small number of significant causal rules are selected through Stability Selection to control for family-wise error rate in the finite sample setting. It proposes various estimation methods for the conditional causal effects for each discovered causal rule. It is highly flexible and implements multiple causal estimands and imputation methods.

We followed standard R package development practices. We provide comprehensive unit testing, and the package is tested on the following operating systems:

- Windows Server 2022, R-devel, 64 bit
- macOS 10.13.6 High Sierra, R-release, brew
- Fedora Linux, R-devel, clang, gfortran
- Ubuntu Linux 20.04.1 LTS, R-release, GCC
