## Submission (October 20, 2022)

Thank you for taking the time to review the CRE 0.1.1 package.

- An issue with the package (ver 0.1.0) was brought up to our attention by 
Prof. Brian Ripley (thank you!). We fixed the issues. 
- Since the package provides different approaches to estimate individual treatment effects, we have many dependencies. We transferred some of the dependencies to the Suggests section and handled the code and test accordingly.  
- We also tested the package on rhub on macOS that raised the issue:
  - macOS 10.13.6 High Sierra, R-release, brew
