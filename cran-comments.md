Submission (June 14, 2023):

We appreciate your efforts in reviewing the CRE 0.2.4 package. In this upgrade:

- We updated description file for method paper. 
- We dropped `baggr` package from suggests that were causing a note during checks.

All tests and checks have passed successfully, and we have also conducted a thorough examination of the package on rhub.
