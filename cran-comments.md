Submission (April 17, 2023):

We appreciate your efforts in reviewing the CRE 0.2.2 package. We have been notified of failing tests on two operating systems and have taken action to address the issue in this submission.

All tests and checks have passed successfully, and we have also conducted a thorough examination of the package on rhub.
