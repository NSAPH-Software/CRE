Submission (April 27, 2023):

We appreciate your efforts in reviewing the CRE 0.2.3 package. We have been 
informed about the archiving of one of the CRE dependencies. Following 
discussions with the dependency package author, we came to understand that the 
problem will not be addressed promptly. As it was just one technique among 
various approaches in the package, we decided to remove the method from the 
package.


All tests and checks have passed successfully, and we have also conducted a 
thorough examination of the package on rhub.

Best regards,
